<h2>Selecting Your Schedule</h2>
<p>To select the schedule to display, first select your school from the drop-down list. Once you have selected a school, 
select the schedule you want to view. Click "Load Schedule." If the schedule has been submitted and input then it will appear on the screen. If the schedule 
has not been submitted and input yet, you will see a message informing you to contact your building's IT Support Technician or <a href="https://techlink.cmcss.net/Support/WorkOrders/Create" target="_blank">submit a work order</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not choose both a school and a schedule, you will see an error message indicating that you must select both.</p>

<h2>Bookmarking This Page</h2>
<p>To bookmark a specific school or school/schedule combination, you must add information to the URL of the page. 
To bookmark a specific school, type the following into the address bar and create a bookmark of the link: <strong>blcmcss.github.io/schedule?[XXX]</strong> where 
<strong>[XXX]</strong> is replaced by the acronym for your school (found in the drop-down list of schools). Note that the acronyms are <strong>case-sensitive</strong>.</p>

<p>To bookmark a specific school/schedule combination, repeat the above step and add <strong>?[XXXX]</strong> where <strong>[XXXX]</strong> is replaced by the lower-case, 
hyphenated name of the schedule (see the list below for options) to the end of the URL.

<ul>
	<li>normal</li>
	<li>half-day</li>
	<li>1-hour-delay</li>
	<li>2-hour-delay</li>
	<li>am-pep-rally</li>
	<li>pm-pep-rally</li>
</ul>

For example, to bookmark the Half Day schedule for Richview Middle school I would bookmark the following URL: <strong>blcmcss.github.io/schedule?RMS?half-day</strong>
